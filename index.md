## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Carlota Champalimaud, and I am a third-year mechanical engineering student at Cornell University, passionate about mechanical design in the automotive industry. I thrive on the creative freedom this field offers, from designing a Frogzskin “window” for a CVT guard to selecting materials that optimize performance.
​
As a member of Cornell Baja Racing, I apply classroom concepts to real-world challenges, while Cornell Polo fosters my teamwork and balance beyond academics. I enjoy learning by doing, pushing the boundaries of design and problem-solving in hands-on, meaningful ways.
